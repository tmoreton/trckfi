Mint has been the go-to finance app for over 15 years. But with their recent shutdown [announcement](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/2/23943254/mint-intuit-shutting-down-credit-karma) by Intuit, millions of loyal users need a new solution. Some have decades of financial data in Mint, and key features like budgeting and net worth tracking won't be available in the replacement app Credit Karma.

If you relied on Mint for budgeting, tracking expenses, or monitoring net worth, it's time to find an alternative aligned with your financial needs.

## **Why "Free" Personal Finance Apps Aren't Really Free?**

Building a slick personal finance app with bank connections is extremely expensive, largely due to data aggregation costs.

**So how do free apps generate revenue?** Often through:

- Pushing financial products for referral fees - even if they’re not the ideal fit for users

- Selling user data - raising privacy concerns

- Stagnant product development from limited resources

To make up the costs, **Mint dabbled in promoting financial products** for referral cash. Unfortunately, it wasn't always in the best interest of the users.

> Bottom line - when you're not paying, you're the product. Your data, attention, whatever is getting sold.

This creates tension between revenue and serving user needs. Free apps inevitably become **ad platforms first, and finance tools second**. In the case of Mint - ad revenue wasn't enough and now they are [shutting down](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/business/mint-app-closing-intuit.html).

### Top 7 Mint Alternatives to Consider

Paid apps align with YOUR interests, not advertisers. You're the real customer. You get better data, privacy protection, and products that evolve to meet your needs.

If they don’t evolve, you the **user can cancel a subscription anytime**, so they need to move quickly and really care about customer experience.

With Mint's departure, it's an opportunity to **explore** **alternatives** that align with your financial values. When evaluating these options, pay close attention to key features:

- Do you prefer detailed expense tracking or a more hands-off approach?

- Are you into in-depth budgeting or flexible spending guidance?

- Do you need automated categorization or prefer manual transaction input?

- Are reporting tools and visibility into your net worth essential for you?

## **Here are 7 Personal Finance Apps to Replace Mint**

## Take Control of Your Finances

Mint, a long-standing favorite for managing personal finances will shut down in January 2024. The challenge users face is that mint was “free” and most financial apps aren’t.

But as covered in this post building a great finance app with bank connections is extremely expensive, largely due to data aggregation costs.

**So how do free apps pay for it?** These apps make money by pushing financial products for referral fees or selling your data, which raises privacy concerns.

> When you're not paying, the app's real customer is whoever is - typically advertisers.

This fundamental misalignment explains why many **free finance apps eventually struggle**. Revenue trumps user experience.

Paid subscription apps **incentivize your success over profits**. And provide personalized education for long-term growth.
