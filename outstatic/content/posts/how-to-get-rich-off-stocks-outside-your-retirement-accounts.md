How Do Wealthy Americans Make Money?

The answer's clear: it's all about investing in stocks.

For the ultra-wealthy, stocks have been the golden ticket, making up **70% of their wealth increase** recently.

And today, I‚Äôll show you how to get rich off stocks so you can build wealth just like the top 1%.

Let‚Äôs get started.

## **Can I Really Get Rich with Stocks?**

Yes, you totally can. Stocks have been a solid way to create wealth. But it takes a long time and it‚Äôs not easy. You need to follow the right strategy such as buying and holding and being consistent. Now if you do follow that strategy then it becomes easier.

### **How to Get Rich Off Stocks?**

The roadmap to getting rich by investing in stocks is actually quite simple but to do it confidently there are concepts you need to understand.

This guide will provide you with the foundation, you need to start building wealth in the stock market.

#### The key 3 things I want you to remember are:¬†



Understand your **risk tolerance**, **diversify your portfolio**, and **don‚Äôt try to time the market**, hold onto investments for the long term.

So if you want to become wealthy by investing in the stock market, follow these steps:

## **1\. Stock Market Basics for Beginners**

The very first step is to understand the stock market basics like:

- Market volatility

- Long-term investing

- Consistently investing

To be successful and stay long in the game to get rich with investing, you need to become comfortable with these terms.

**Note:** You won‚Äôt become a millionaire from the stock market overnight. There's plenty of advice out there that doesn't really work. But if you're patient and keep investing for many, many years, your chances of hitting that millionaire mark are pretty good.

The biggest difference between investing in **index funds** and **investing in stocks** is risk.

If you‚Äôre a beginner investor and simply want to get started I recommend checking the **S&P 500 Index fund**.

If you are an advanced investor, I‚Äôd still recommend checking the **S&P 500 Index fund**!

You see the S&P 500 Index Fund tracks the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States and is considered a good indicator of the overall stock market's performance.

And it gets better:

The S&P 500 Index fund has returned an average of about **10% annually** before inflation since its introduction in 1957, performing above many other markets over this period.

![null](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/YQl_EeGDoRE1V9hG_EKM2MB7HVJu7hpPWavXkKMJ77WAT5GFs-lsmz2t-tfa-zh6_y8WINpOaaLyqq-TajK_3v7NmY6pSrw2TorCS0YAYP5m4xHxbPDv6gAilNcAArEcTfXBDrNXsM2ETErAeWR42-Q)

While there are some dips in the chart here are some things you need to know:

- **Diversify Easily:** Spread your risk by investing in a mix of 500 leading companies across various sectors in the U.S. stock market.

- **Strong Track Record:** Historically averages about a 10% annual return.

- **Low Costs:** Keep more of your money working for you. Enjoy lower fees compared to actively managed funds, which means more of your investment goes towards growth.

- **Simple Choice:** One fund, with broad exposure to the entire US market, making it an easy choice for beginners and seasoned investors alike.

Once you understand the stock market better, and become comfortable knowing that the market has ups and downs, getting rich from stocks will come easier than you think.

## **2\. Make Goals for Your Investment Vision**

Here's a little secret that helps people build wealth faster:

Treat your investments like they're part of your [**monthly expenses**](/blog/budgeting-made-easy).

Include your regular investments in your monthly budget and plan.

**Why?**

Because when you budget for your investments, you can easily track how much you've put in over time.

It's truly a game-changer.

So how do you track your investment and overall spending?

TRCKFI gives you the tools to understand where you are presently and what you need to do to get to your [financial goals](/blog/savings).

Again, if you‚Äôre serious about tracking your finances and investments, TRCKFI makes it very easy and less scary.

## **3\. Understand Your Risk Tolerance**

The next step is figuring out how much risk you're comfortable taking with your money in the stock market.

Remember, investing in the stock market always comes with risk. It's best to invest money you won't need for the next 2-5 years.

For example, if you're planning to buy a house in the next year, avoid putting your down payment in the stock market due to its volatility.

Before we dive in, let‚Äôs define two terms that will continue to show:

- **Stocks:** Ownership shares in a company, giving you a slice of its profits and growth potential.

- **Bonds:** Loans you give to governments or companies, earning you regular interest payments and the return of your principal at maturity.

Okay, let‚Äôs look at a broad overview of the investor risk spectrum:

![](/images/screen-shot-2024-02-27-at-11.15.35-am-g3Mj.png)

If losing 30% to 50% of your portfolio's value would keep you up at night, you might be a moderate or conservative investor.

And if you think you'll need a lot of money for a comfortable retirement, you might need to take on more risk focusing on **stocks** vs **bonds** for higher potential rewards.

## **4\. Automate Your Investments**

Want to make investing even simpler? Try automating it.

**Here's the scoop:**

- **Invest Continiuosly:** Set up automatic transfers to your investment account. This way, you invest consistently without even thinking about it.

- **Stay Invested:** Automating helps you invest without getting caught up in market ups and downs. You stick to your plan, no matter what.

- **Grow Your Money:** Regular investments can really add up over time, thanks to compounding. It's like planting a money tree that keeps on growing!

**Getting started is easy:**

1. **Pick Your Platform:** Whether it's a low-cost index fund or a robo-advisor, choose where you want to invest.

2. **Set Up Auto-Transfers:** Decide how much you want to invest regularly and set up automatic transfers from your bank account.

3. **Keep an Eye on It**: Use your [monthly money dates](/blog/quick-monthly-financial-checkin-routine) to check in on your investments now and then. This will help you stay motivated as you'll see your money grow.

## **5\. Create Your Investment Plan and Strategy**

Choosing Between **Passive** and **Active** Investing

Understanding your investment style is crucial:

- **Active Investor:** Tries to *‚Äútime the market‚Äù*, its goal is to outperform the market with day trading. It‚Äôs a bad idea and the reason why too many investors go broke.

- **Passive Investor:** Focuses on ‚Äútime in the market‚Äù which is the opposite of trying to time the market, matching market performance through a buy-and-hold approach.

While active investing and day trading might sound tempting and even sexy, it‚Äôs actually shown to be less profitable over time. And the reason why so many people go broke.

I call it gambling.

For example, check out the percentage of actively managed funds that failed to beat the market:

![](/images/_-percentage-of-active-public-trades-that-failed-to-outperformed-the-index--2--AwOT.png)

Actively managed funds have generally failed to outperform the index over time.

**Keep in mind:**

Active fund managers often have high fees that can reduce your profits.

That's why passive investing is a better choice.

Passive investing is less stressful and less costly, it‚Äôs been proven to be a more affordable way to build wealth over the long term.

### Are you a technical investor or a fundamental investor?<br>



Second, you‚Äôll also want to take a closer look into whether you‚Äôre a technical or fundamental investor:

- **Technical Investor:** You analyze statistical trends in a stock's price and volume over time, attempting to time the market for short-term gains.

- **Fundamental Investor:** You focus on long-term investments and the overall economy, investing regardless of market conditions, confident that over time, despite fluctuations, it will pay off.

If you‚Äôre a day trader or a swing trader looking for short-term gains, technical analysis is for you.

If you‚Äôre a long-term investor and want to buy and hold stocks to create wealth no matter the fluctuations in the market then consider yourself a fundamental investor.

### **DIY Investing vs. Professional Advice**

Do you need to consider hiring an investment advisor (or not)?

If you have questions and feel you need the help of a financial advisor, I would highly recommend you consider hiring a fiduciary investment advisor.

**What‚Äôs that?**

A fiduciary investment advisor is someone who is required by law to do what is in your absolute best interest.

So by law, fiduciaries are forbidden to sell you products that don‚Äôt fit your financial strategy.

Non-fiduciaries may sell you products that aren‚Äôt the best for you ‚Äì but these products earn high commissions.

[![fiduciaries-investment-advisor-services](/images/screen-shot-2024-02-27-at-11.25.08-am-YzMD.png)](https://hellonectarine.com/)

**Pro Tip:¬†**

Look for investment advisors with the CFP(r) marks - aka Certified Financial Planner.

CFP(r)‚Äôs are fiduciaries and are the gold standard when it comes to financial planning.

If you decide to go with a financial advisor, then I highly recommend checking out [Nectarine](https://hellonectarine.com/).

**Why?¬†**

You pay only for Investing Advice

They don‚Äôt manage your money, sell any products, or earn any commissions.

One hour, no strings attached for a flat fee of $150.

## **6\. How do Index Funds Differ From Stocks?**

- **Stocks:** When you buy a stock, you own a piece of a single company. If the company does well, the value of your stock can go up, and you might make a profit. You might also get dividends, which are a share of the company's profits.

- **Index Funds:** An index fund is like a basket of many different stocks. It's a way to invest in lots of companies at once. This can spread out your risk because you're not just relying on one company to do well.

In short, stocks are about betting on one company, while index funds are about investing in many companies at once.

**Investing in Index Funds My Favorite Strategy**

Index funds follow a market index, like the S&P 500. They aim to match the market, not beat it. They're low-cost and passively managed.

Take the S&P 500 index fund as an example. By investing in one, you're essentially investing in all 500 companies in the index, like big names such as Tesla, Apple, and Facebook.

**Why is this great?**

- **Diversification:** Key to a strong portfolio.

- **Low Cost:** Saves you money.

- **High Returns:** Potential for solid gains.

- **Tax-Efficient:** Fewer tax headaches.

- **Passively Managed:** Less hassle for you.

And gets better

![](/images/probability-of-an-active-equity-fund-beating-the-market--1--gyOD.png)

For **long-term investors**, index funds are a solid way to grow wealth.

Active funds often struggle to outperform the market, especially when you factor in their higher fees.

For instance, while active funds might charge 1% or more, index funds often charge as little as 0.05%.

Over time, this difference can really add up.

So how do you invest in index funds?

If you‚Äôre a beginner investor, then check out Betterment üëá

[![betterment-investing-platform](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/cNLEAa4b4GCvpycQVWq_c692eZ2q61kY6LIAiBmjBN-GbT4-uz7O4UXMKMABZfc2yNbbrdJ4aXkwTRTTiW_U6cpQOgKf5r1u-qiDxjL-oLwJqoBE5onTJ6hEjS_O5CAn5GQgzfygm3t8wr2WFHyVUhA)](betterment.com/friend-referral-offer?referral_key=bWFyaWFjYW5kZWxhcmlhY29yZG9iYQ==)

I like Betterment ‚Äì especially for beginner investors ‚Äì because you can start investing with just $5. That‚Äôs it!

What's great is the consistency: the amount you invest isn't as important as investing regularly. [Betterment](betterment.com/friend-referral-offer?referral_key=bWFyaWFjYW5kZWxhcmlhY29yZG9iYQ==) supports this with options for recurring investments, like $10 a week or more, making it easy to stay on track.

After you‚Äôve invested your first $5, you can automate your investing on a weekly, biweekly or even monthly basis.

**Betterment** supports this with options for recurring investments, like $10 a week or more, making it easy to stay on track.

## **7\. Buying & Selling Individual Stocks is a Gamble**

Buying and selling individual stocks is what I consider** gambling**, you can get lucky and earn much higher returns or lose all your money in the game‚Ä¶ and maybe even go broke.

**So why do people do it?**

People gamble because they hope they might get lucky and outsmart the game. The same idea applies to buying and selling individual stocks, where the goal is to beat the market.

And we all like to believe that we're smarter than the rest.

**The downside?**

It's riskier and time-consuming. Even if you can predict trends, just like gambling, you'll inevitably face some losses too.

However, let‚Äôs cover some *‚Äúperceived benefits‚Äù* of buying individual stocks:

- Liquid

- Buy fractional shares

- Higher potential returns

- More tax-efficient than mutual funds

Technically, you can get rich from investing if you select the right stocks. Like you can get rich if you win the lottery‚Ä¶.

Now, this rule applies to all investing strategies:

**Remain calm during volatile times. Don‚Äôt rush to sell in a panic.**

## **8\. Buy & Hold Investment Strategy Benefits**<br>



Trying to time the market sounds sexy and exciting, but it can hurt your portfolio.

Here‚Äôs is a beautiful visual created by [Visual Capitals](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/chart-timing-the-market/) showing you why:

![null](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/wwbR5vmxz4MhAtSRpn8pB2KNbpsq4XLzgVFI9XDC7FPPlfSc3C0j3TRBxUtlqCEuYgTxS7mq7DTaBZl1B8qTpOXquc4UN0WGc5vUBHz8bUMABk5V-AOjK0-C7ZiDMrERREJrzfhiEyLpNrJYCIzMCzE)

By simply missing out on the 10 best days in the stock market, you could lose their overall return, significantly hurting your overall wealth.

Of course, there are other benefits to buying and holding as well, such as:

- Increased tax efficiency

- Collect additional dividends

Plus, from a tax standpoint, holding your investments rather than selling them shortly after buying can help lower your tax bill at the end of the year.

## **9\. Consistency in Investing**

Keep investing on a set schedule, no matter what the market is doing.

That‚Äôs the secret to becoming rich off stocks.

The markets will fluctuate, but if you just keep investing on a set schedule (whether that‚Äôs weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc.) it will pay off.

This approach is known as dollar-cost averaging (DCA) and it‚Äôs also used by the pros.

This strategy helps you buy at different price points, stretching your money further.

**Quick Tip:**

Automation plays a huge role in helping you stay on track with your investments. Remember to make your recurring investments part of your regular *‚Äúmonthly expenses‚Äù* by paying yourself first.

You can set up a DCA plan directly from your investing app.

One of the best investing apps that helps you DCA is [**Betterment**](betterment.com/friend-referral-offer?referral_key=bWFyaWFjYW5kZWxhcmlhY29yZG9iYQ==).

### **How to Use an Effective Tax Strategy?**<br>



Investing can make you rich but don't forget about taxes. They can really affect how much money you make from your investments.

Here's what you need to know:

- If you invest in special accounts like [IRAs](/blog/types-of-ira-investing) or [401](/blog/401k-retirement-plans-guide-for-smart-saving)[(k)s,](/blog/traditional-401k-plan) you don't pay taxes when you sell stocks. You only pay taxes when you take money out.

- If you invest in regular accounts, you have to pay taxes in the year you buy or sell stocks.

When you sell something for more than you paid, you have to pay capital gains tax.

> **Capital gains** are the profits you make when you sell an investment, like stocks or property, for more than you paid for it.

**There are two kinds:**

- Short-term capital gains: If you sell something you've owned for less than a year, you pay taxes like it's regular income.

- Long-term capital gains: If you sell something you've owned for more than a year, you pay less in taxes.

And this is where the strategy of\*\* tax-loss harvesting\*\* comes into the picture

### **Tax-Loss Harvesting Explained**

Tax-loss harvesting is a way to lower your taxes. You sell some investments that made money and some that lost money. This balances things out and can reduce your tax bill.

### **The Advantage of Tax-Loss Harvesting**

This can be really helpful if you want to make money from stocks and worry about taxes. Betterment could be a great choice for you.

**Why Betterment?**

Betterment is a service that makes saving and investing simple. They help you grow your money by creating a personalized investment plan. They also offer [tax-loss harvesting](https://www.betterment.com/tax-loss-harvesting), which not all services do.

### **How do beginners make money in the stock market?**

Making money in the stock market is for everyone. Just start early, keep investing, and do it regularly.

Begin with opening an account that helps you invest and start with just $1 a week. Over time, even small amounts grow big because of compound interest.

That's how beginners can end up with lots of money in the stock market.

## **Mastering Stock Market Wealth Wrap Up**<br>



Getting rich from stocks is pretty simple. Many Americans are already taking advantage of the stock market and generating passive income through it.

As you look into investing more, remember these important steps:

- Do your research

- Invest consistently

- Buy and hold for the long term

I think investing is a lot simpler than the financial industry makes it see. You do need to understand your level of risk tolerance and also make sure you don't fall for the *"get rich quick scam"* aka trying to time the market with day trading.

As you look into more information you'll need a little common sense.

Make sure you are optimizing your investments by taking advantage of tax advantage accounts first as much as possible:
