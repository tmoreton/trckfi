With all this talk about economic ups and downs, we're diving into a topic that's on everyone's minds: **cash** – how much is enough, and how much is too much? I get it – it can feel like everyone's shouting different advice, and it's hard to know what's what.

### How Much Cash I You Need?

Let's start with the basics. You've probably heard various recommendations – from stashing a year's worth of expenses under your mattress to keeping everything in your checking account for easy access. But the truth is, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. Your ideal cash reserve depends on your unique circumstances and it's always better to be prepared and clear on your situation. Not sure what your monthly expenses are? Read more [here](/blog/tracking-monthly-expenses).

Of course, there are general guidelines suggesting having 4-6 months' worth of living expenses in cash as a buffer provides a safety net in case of emergencies, such as unexpected medical bills or unemployment. If you need $5,000 to survive every month, save $30,000.

However, an **eight-month** [emergency fund](/blog/building-an-emergency-fund) can be a better fit because that’s about how long it takes the average person to find a new job. As we all have seen an insane wave of layoffs over the past 12 months - according to layoff tracker [Layoffs.fyi ](http://layoffs.fyi/)\- tech companies alone laid off more than 260,000 workers last year and over 34,000 in 2024.

Ideally, you want to have enough cash to get you through a tough moment without having to turn into [credit card debt](/blog/how-to-get-out-of-debt) to sustain yourself and your dependents. It's going to give you peace of mind and resources to alleviate the stress that comes along with [losing a job](/blog/career-advice-supporting-loved-ones-job-search) or any emergency.

## Where Should I Keep the Cash?

### Is it better to keep in checking or invested? Or both?

Now that we covered the basic idea of how much cash you should aim to have, let's look at where to keep it. There is a lot of **bad advice on TikTok** and other social media platforms that tell people to keep cash in their checking accounts in case they need a quick withdrawal. Or the opposite to invest it on the stock market… **Both pieces of advice suck**, here is why:

By keeping cash in your checking or regular savings your money is sitting and losing value (due to inflation) and investing defeats the purpose of having that money handy in case of an emergency. Short-term investing is risky - it's not insured or recommended for emergency fund.

- Keep **one month of expenses** in your **checking account**, you don't need more than that. You can always set your savings account as a backup to avoid defaulting on a withdrawal.

- Earn interest in your emergency cash. Open a high-yield saving account that earns more than 4% APY and is FDIC insured. Ally Bank provides a great HYSA and you can [earn up to $125 when you join](https://www.ally.com/referral?code=4H3G4S7N9D).

## What if I'm a Small Business Owner?

The equation shifts slightly. Having a robust cash reserve can mean the difference between weathering a storm and shuttering your business. In times of crisis, having cash on hand allows you to cover operational expenses, retain employees, and pivot your strategy as needed. It's your lifeline when unforeseen challenges arise. So, how do you strike the right balance? Here are some actionable tips to guide you:

- \*\*Assess Your Needs: \*\*Take stock of your financial situation. Consider your monthly expenses, income sources, and any potential risks or obligations. This evaluation will help you determine how much cash you need to keep on hand.

- **Emergency Fund Essentials:** Aim to build a robust emergency fund equivalent to 4-6 months' worth of expenses. This fund should cover necessities like rent or mortgage payments, utilities, groceries, and insurance premiums.

- \*\*Diversify Your Holdings: \*\*While cash is king in emergencies, it's essential to diversify your holdings for long-term financial stability. Explore investment options such as stocks, bonds, and real estate to grow your wealth over time.

- \*\*Regularly Reevaluate: \*\*Life is unpredictable, and your financial needs may change over time. Make it a habit to reassess your cash reserves periodically and adjust them as necessary. A windfall, job change, or major life event may warrant a reassessment of your financial priorities.

- **Plan for the Unexpected:** Anticipate potential setbacks and plan accordingly. Consider factors like [job security](/blog/career-advice-supporting-loved-ones-job-search), health issues, or market downturns when determining your cash needs. A proactive approach can help you navigate challenges with confidence.

- **Seek Professional Guidance:** If you're unsure about the best approach for your financial situation, don't hesitate to seek advice from a qualified financial advisor. They can offer personalized guidance based on your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

## How to Get Started?

Starting your emergency fund, whether for personal or business purposes, is a crucial step towards financial stability. Here's how to get started:

**Personal Emergency Fund:** Begin now and start small. Allocate a portion of your income, ideally 10%, towards your emergency fund. This initial contribution may seem modest, but consistency is key. Even small amounts gradually add up over time. Set up **automatic transfers** from your checking account to your designated emergency savings account to ensure regular contributions without effort. Every paycheck asses if you can increase your contribution by **1-5% more** this will help you build your **6-8 months emergency fund** quicker. This is critical to living a life with less stress about money and more happiness.

**Business Emergency Fund:** Similar to personal finances, initiating a business emergency fund requires commitment and consistency. Begin by saving for a few months' worth of operating expenses, aiming for a reserve of **2-3 months initially**. Don't be discouraged if you can't save large amounts immediately; the important thing is to start. As your revenue permits, gradually increase your contributions to the fund. Ideally, aim to accumulate enough to cover at least a year's worth of operating expenses.

The events of Covid-19 and the rise of inflation emphasized the importance of being prepared for unexpected challenges, reinforcing the need for robust financial reserves in business operations. Learn from this lesson and prioritize building your emergency fund steadily over time. Remember, the journey to financial security begins with the first step.
