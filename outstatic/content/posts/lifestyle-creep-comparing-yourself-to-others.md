I find that this time of year tends to be oddly emotional as we adapt to a new year and navigate the seasonal changes.

Specifically around Valentine’s Day, half of February is gone and it’s easy to feel a type of way if you aren’t where you want to be.

And even if you are where you want to be, it’s okay to not feel okay too.

As the first quarter progresses, it’s natural for us to begin seeking out new opportunities and setting fresh objectives. Our culture constantly bombards us with messages to hustle harder, aim for more, and live a life defined by others’ standards of success.

This phenomenon, known as **lifestyle creep**, happens when we start spending more whenever our income increases. But we need to ask ourselves - at what cost? We work harder, aiming for 'more'—more money, bigger houses, newer cars, lavish vacations—all to impress others. This race often leads to more stress and less happiness, as we chase goals that aren’t really our own and we compare to others.

## Comparing Yourself to Others & Lifestyle Creep

It’s really hard to be on social media nowadays and not* *compare yourself to others. Your business isn’t good enough, your wardrobe isn’t trendy enough, and your house isn’t Pottery-Barn enough. It might even make you feel like *you *aren’t enough.

But what you're seeing people's highlight reels on Instagram, just like any other social media platform.

My own posts are totally a highlight reel. And too used to also feel anxious going through my feed and seeing all the things others are doing. Like I was falling behind.

## **Real-Life Effects of Comparing Yourself to Others**

Keeping up with the Joneses causes financial distress. This isn’t a money issue—it’s a heart issue. For People who see their friends get an upgrade in lifestyle and, all of a sudden, they think they need one too—even though they can't afford it, the problem is not about how much they earn, but how they manage it.

There’s nothing wrong with enjoying life and the fruits of your work as long as you're **paying yourself first** (saving & investing) and you're mindful of your spending. Like you're aware of your spending habits and have clear goals.

However, when you pile up a bunch of stuff and go neck-deep into debt to buy it all just to impress your neighbor (in person or on Instagram), you don’t even really own your stuff—it owns you. The debt takes over and steals all your income, and you suddenly become a servant to the things you thought would make you happy.

A rising number of Americans, including those with higher incomes, find themselves living paycheck to paycheck due to inflation and the increase in lifestyle spending.
