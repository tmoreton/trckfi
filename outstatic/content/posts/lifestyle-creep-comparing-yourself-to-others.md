I find that this time of year tends to be oddly emotional as we adapt to a new year and navigate the seasonal changes.

Specifically around Valentine’s Day, half of February is gone and it’s easy to feel a type of way if you aren’t where you want to be.

And even if you are where you want to be, it’s okay to not feel okay too.

As the first quarter progresses, it’s natural for us to begin seeking out new opportunities and setting fresh objectives. Our culture constantly bombards us with messages to hustle harder, aim for more, and live a life defined by others’ standards of success.

This phenomenon, known as **lifestyle creep**, happens when we start spending more whenever our income increases. But we need to ask ourselves - at what cost? We work harder, aiming for 'more'—more money, bigger houses, newer cars, lavish vacations—all to impress others. This race often leads to more stress and less happiness, as we chase goals that aren’t really our own and we compare to others.

As we reflect on our progress and set new goals, remember that [mindset](/blog/money-mindset-shift-unlock-wealth-escape-broke) and [financial wellness](https://www.trckfi.com/blog/savings) are key part of achieving our dreams.

## Comparing Yourself to Others leads to Lifestyle Creep

It’s really hard to be on social media nowadays and not\* \*compare yourself to others. Your business isn’t good enough, your wardrobe isn’t trendy enough, and your house isn’t Pottery-Barn enough. It might even make you feel like \*you \*aren’t enough.

But what you're seeing people's highlight reels on Instagram, just like any other social media platform.

My own posts are totally a highlight reel. And too used to also feel anxious going through my feed and seeing all the things others are doing. Like I was falling behind.

## **Real-Life Effects of Comparing Yourself to Others**

Keeping up with the Joneses causes financial distress. This isn’t a money issue—it’s a heart issue. For People who see their friends get an upgrade in lifestyle and, all of a sudden, they think they need one too—even though they can't afford it, the problem is not about how much they earn, but how they manage it.

There’s nothing wrong with enjoying life and the fruits of your work as long as you're **paying yourself first** (saving & investing) and you're mindful of your spending. Like you're aware of your spending habits and have clear goals.

However, when you pile up a bunch of stuff and go neck-deep into debt to buy it all just to impress your neighbor (in person or on Instagram), you don’t even really own your stuff—it owns you. The debt takes over and steals all your income, and you suddenly become a servant to the things you thought would make you happy.

A rising number of Americans, including those with higher incomes, find themselves living paycheck to paycheck due to inflation and the increase in lifestyle spending. Even Americans earning $100,000 or more are struggling to cover monthly expenses, leading nearly half to [fall deeper into debt](https://www.trckfi.com/blog/how-to-get-out-of-debt).

This phenomenon, known as **lifestyle creep**, happens when we start spending more whenever our income increases. But we need to ask ourselves - at what cost? We work harder, aiming for 'more'—more money, bigger houses, newer cars, lavish vacations—all to impress others. This race often leads to more stress and less happiness, as we chase goals that aren’t really our own.

## Signs of Lifestyle Creep

### **Your spending has gone up, but your savings hasn’t.**

Listen, I’m a natural-born spender. It’s not on the level of a [shopping addiction](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/budgeting/shopping-addiction). I’m just geared toward spending money, and I love spending it.

But I know that about myself. So if my income goes up, I know I’ve got to be diligent about where that money goes.

So, if your spending is on the rise but your savings isn’t, that’s another clue you might be experiencing lifestyle creep.

## Impact on Your Financial Health

Lifestyle creep is harmful to your [financial health](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/budgeting/ways-to-improve-financial-health) and your [financial security](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/budgeting/financial-security). You’re trading the future for the present—but you aren’t even really aware you’re doing it!

Listen, if you get a raise or start making extra money some other way—take a minute to celebrate it with friends and family. But then, start making a plan for what to do with that money. Or the next year will come and go without you even realizing what you spent it on.

## 4 Ways to Avoid **Lifestyle Creep**

### **1\. Plan for the future.**

All of your money decisions will flow out of what’s important to you. Your career choices, purchases, investments, college selection for the kids—everything! So, let’s start there!

Take some time to think about your values. Then, write down your financial goals and put up pictures of those goals so you can be reminded of why you’re taking up the fight against lifestyle creep. You have to put in the work *today* to get the tomorrow you’re dreaming of. And trust me, it’s worth it.

### **2\. Set up automatic transfers.**

Once you’ve made the budget and trimmed it, do yourself a favor and set up some automatic transfers to help you move forward with your goals.

For example, if you’re trying to build up that savings account, have some of your paycheck go straight into savings—or set up an automatic transfer that moves money from your checking to savings at least once a month.

Or, if you’re on [Baby Step 4](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/budgeting/how-to-win-with-money-in-7-easy-baby-steps), set up 15% of your income to go straight into your retirement accounts.

Hey, you didn’t notice that raise when you were spending it here and there. This is a way to be in control—*on the front end*—of where your money goes.

### **3\. Get to know your money mindset.**

Your [money mindset](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/budgeting/understanding-your-money-mindset) is your unique set of beliefs and your attitude about finances. It drives the decisions you make about saving, spending and handling money. A lot goes into what your money mindset is—including your past and your personality. If you can get a handle on your money mindset, you can get a handle on your life.

### **4\. Practice generosity.**

How can [giving back](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/budgeting/importance-of-giving-back) help? Well, lifestyle creep naturally encourages us to think about ourselves. Generosity moves the focus off of us (our problems, our money, our wants) and on to others. It’s a great way to make a shift in your money mindset *and* help others at the same time.
