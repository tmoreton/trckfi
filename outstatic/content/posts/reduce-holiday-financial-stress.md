The holidays are supposed to be fun and festive, but this year maybe they should also be frugal? With so many Americans struggling financially, we’ll show you how to talk to your family about finances and make this holiday season less stressful.

Normally, the holidays are a mix of fun and stress. But as the impact of [inflation](/blog/expense-management-guide) continues to ravage people’s wallets, more people are finding that the holidays are only making their finances worse than normal, leading to an increase in** financial stress during the holidays**.

It's not just gifts, travel or invitations to holiday parties. The collective pressure to spend money can suck the joy right out of what’s supposed to be “the most wonderful time of the year.”

So as awkward as it might be, it’s important to talk about holiday spending with your family, friends and others before it becomes a sore spot.

Here are my favorite strategies to make the holidays more of a joyous event and less of a financial obligation.

## 1\. Turn gift anxiety into quality time

Every year, I write an article about how many Americans go into credit card [debt](/blog/how-to-get-out-of-debt) to pay for holiday gifts. Not only that, spending hours in a mall or shopping online isn’t the most pleasant way to spend your time.

Last year, I decided to take a different approach. My husband and I approached my brother-in-law and sister-in-law and proposed doing a group dinner together instead of buying gifts.

They loved the idea. And instead of buying something that might add clutter and stress, we all had a fancy dinner and enjoyed each other’s company instead.

If you have someone in your life that you dread shopping for, try suggesting an experience instead. You can go bowling, attend a cooking class or just go to the movies. This can reduce the holiday financial stress you feel this season.

## 2\. Bring up your money worries early

I have a core group of college friends who travel together once a year. I don’t remember how the conversation came up, but one time we started talking about birthday gifts. That’s when we realized that we all feel pressure to buy each other birthday gifts when we don’t really feel like it. Now, we skip the gifts and just send birthday cards instead.

If you want to suggest skipping Christmas gifts with someone, now’s the perfect time to bring it up. Be casual about it and frame the request as something that will benefit both people.

Also, don’t assume people won’t be interested in your proposal. You never know what someone’s financial situation is like - even if their Instagram feed looks like it’s all vacations and dinners.

## 3\. Suggest a white elephant party

If you still can afford some kind of present, suggest a white elephant party - with a theme. For example, everyone can bring a copy of the best book they read in the past year. I know of an Instagram influencer who has a “favorite things” party with her girlfriends where everyone brings their favorite thing that they bought in the past year.

Also, make sure to set a price limit that everyone can comfortably afford. If you know that things are really tight for people, you can even have a thrift party where everyone brings something they already have and want to get rid of. A friend of mine told me that she and her family do a homemade Christmas gift exchange where they draw names and make a gift instead of buying one.

## 4\.** **Reduce holiday **financial stress **by spending time together with a potluck

My favorite part of the holiday season is just spending time with people I love. If you still want the wholesome aspect of the holidays without the financial guilt, try organizing a potluck.

Everyone should bring one dish to share. If you want to make it even more fun, encourage people to bring a board game they have.

A few years ago I was invited to a Christmas cookie party, which is another fun idea. Everyone brings a batch of cookies and you get to try everyone else's sweet treats. Plus, the host provided gift boxes so everyone could take home extra cookies.

## Conclusion

This holiday season, focus less on sales hype, more on connecting with loved ones. Discuss money concerns openly - **avoiding stressful obligations** lifts everyone's spirits and reduces holiday financial stress and anxiety.

With higher inflation and widespread job uncertainty, many are facing tougher choices. But through creativity, compassion, and candid conversations, we can recreate celebrations centered on what matters most - meaningful bonds.

Enjoy potlucks, homemade creations, and most importantly, one another. Relieve wallets while filling hearts with laughter and joy. You’ve got this! And tools like **Trckfi** can support your financial wellness journey with easy [expense tracking](/pricing) and money motivation.
