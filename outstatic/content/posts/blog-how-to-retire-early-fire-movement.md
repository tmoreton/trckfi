## The 4% Rule and Safe Withdrawal Rate

Many FIRE followers also go by the rule of 25, saving 25 times your annual expenses to retire, and the 4% rule, **withdrawing 4% or less per year**.

The 4% rule allows safe annual portfolio withdrawals equal to 4% of the initial investment value, adjusting for inflation yearly. This withdrawal rate aims to prevent portfolio depletion during retirement.
