## 1\. Traditional IRA: The Time-Tested Retirement Savings Staple

The Traditional IRA is the seasoned veteran, reigning as the most popular individual tax-advantaged retirement account. Its features include:

- Contribution limits of $6,500 in 2023 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older), with potential tax-deductible contributions depending on your income and workplace retirement plan status.

- Tax-deferred investment earnings, keeping your money shielded from current taxes.

- Taxation on withdrawals in retirement, based on your tax rate at that time.

    **Best for:** Those in higher tax brackets now, expecting lower tax rates in retirement, and without access to a workplace-sponsored retirement plan.

## 2\. Roth IRA: Tax-Free Earnings and Flexible Withdrawals

The Roth IRA stands as the ultimate tax-saving counterpart to the [Traditional](/blog/traditional-ira-guide-tax-advantaged-retirement)[ IRA](/blog/traditional-ira-guide-tax-advantaged-retirement). Its key features are:

- Non-deductible contributions with upfront tax payments, leading to completely tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

- A maximum annual contribution of $6,500 in 2023 ($7,500 for those 50 and older), subject to income limits.

- Lenient withdrawal rules, allowing tax- and penalty-free withdrawals of contributions at any time.

    **Best for:** Savers anticipating **higher tax brackets** in retirement, aiming to take advantage of tax-free withdrawals and potential early access to contributions.

## 3\. SEP IRA: Higher Contributions for Small Business Owners

A type of traditional IRA, the SEP IRA offers exceptional benefits for both employers and employees, including:

- High contribution limits, up to **25% of employee compensation** or $66,000 in 2023, whichever is less.

- Employer contributions required for all eligible employees, with a flexible contribution size based on business cash flow.

- Employers who are also sole proprietors can open a SEP IRA for themselves.

    **Best for:** Small business owners seeking a cost-effective retirement plan and the ability to contribute for their employees.

## 4\. Nondeductible IRA: Make the Most of After-Tax Contributions

When traditional IRA contributions aren't deductible due to income limits, the Nondeductible IRA becomes a viable option, offering:

- After-tax contributions with tax-deferred growth on earnings within the account.

- Taxation on withdrawals based on earnings growth, excluding the principal (already taxed dollars).

    **Best for:** Individuals who don't qualify for Roth or deductible IRA contributions.

For married couples, the Spousal IRA allows non-working spouses to contribute, provided certain criteria are met:

- Joint tax return filing with taxable compensation.

- Contribution limits mirroring traditional or Roth IRAs, based on age and other factors.

    **Best for:** Low-income or non-working individuals married to someone with earned income.

- Lower contribution limits compared to [401(k)s](/blog/traditional-401k-plan), with up to $15,500 in 2023.

- Employer-matching or fixed contributions required for eligible employees.

    **Best for:** Smaller companies with fewer than 100 employees and self-employed individuals.
