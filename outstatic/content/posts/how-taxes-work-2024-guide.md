Taxes may not be the most sexy topic, but they are crucial for everyone living in the United States. It's that time of year again when we need to file our taxes, a task that is as inevitable as it is important.

## Can You Go to Jail for Not Filing Taxes?

The short answer is yes.

Taxes are a critical part of adult life, and failing to file them can lead to serious consequences. When you earn income, the government expects its share. This money funds essential services like healthcare, education, and national defense.

Although the tax code is complex, understanding the basics can help you reduce your tax bill legally and ethically.

## 2024 Income Tax Brackets

Federal income taxes are not flat-rate. Instead, your income falls into different brackets, each taxed at a progressively higher rate. Remember, moving to a higher tax bracket doesn't mean all your income is taxed at that higher rate, only the portion that falls within that bracket.

**Check out the 2024 Federal Income Taxes below for each bracket (if you're filing single):**

![2024-tax-braket-filing-single](/images/screen-shot-2024-03-10-at-9.13.08-am-UzMj.png)

For example, in 2024, if you're single, no matter how much money you make, whether it's $20,000/year or $500,000/year, the first $0 to $11,600 is taxed at 10%, the next $11,601 - $47,150 is taxed at 12%, and so on.

It's a **graduated tax bracket**.

**If you're married, filing jointly, this is what your Federal Income Taxes will look like in 2024:**

Why does this matter? Well, I've come across a lot of people who turn down pay raises or bonuses because they're worried it'll push them into a higher tax bracket.

But here's the thing: welcoming more money is always a wise choice! No matter what tax bracket you're in, you'll still end up with extra cash in your pocket. So, don't hold backâ€”embrace those raises and bonuses with open arms!

## What Is a Tax Return?

A tax return is a document you submit to the IRS detailing your income, expenses, and other financial information. It's like your financial summary for the year.

## What's Included in My Tax Return?

Your tax return includes all your income, deductions, and tax credits. You must report all forms of income, including wages, dividends, and even illegal activities. Deductions and tax credits can reduce your taxable income and the amount of taxes you owe.

## Who Pays Taxes?

Everyone who earns income in the United States is required to pay taxes. This includes employees, self-employed individuals, and business owners. Even if you don't owe any taxes, you may still need to file a return.

## How Do Taxes Work for Entrepreneurs?

Entrepreneurs and small business owners face unique tax considerations. They can deduct business-related expenses, such as office supplies, travel, and professional fees, to lower their taxable income.

However, entrepreneurs must keep detailed records and receipts for all business expenses. Keeping accurate records is essential for taking advantage of deductions and substantiating those deductions in the event of an IRS audit.

Here are some common expenses that entrepreneurs can potentially deduct:

ðŸ’° **Office Supplies and Equipment:** Items like computers, printers, paper, and pens used for business purposes can be deducted.

ðŸ’° **Travel Expenses:** Costs related to business travel, such as airfare, hotel stays, and car rentals, can be deductible.

ðŸ’° **Professional Fees:** Fees paid to attorneys, accountants, and consultants for business-related services can be deducted.

ðŸ’° **Home Office Expenses:** If you use a part of your home exclusively for business, you may be able to deduct expenses like mortgage interest, insurance, utilities, and repairs.

ðŸ’° **Advertising and Marketing:** Costs associated with promoting your business, including website maintenance, social media advertising, and print marketing materials, can be deductible.

ðŸ’° **Vehicle Expenses:** If you use your car for business, you can deduct expenses related to its use, either by using the standard mileage rate or actual expenses like gas, maintenance, and insurance.

ðŸ’° **Education and Training:** Expenses for courses, workshops, and seminars that enhance your business skills or are required for your business can be deductible.

ðŸ’° **Health Insurance Premiums:** If you're self-employed, you may be able to deduct premiums you pay for medical, dental, and qualifying long-term care insurance for yourself, your spouse, and your dependents.

ðŸ’° **Retirement Contributions:** Contributions to a SEP IRA, SIMPLE IRA, or solo 401(k) can be deductible.

Given the complexity of tax rules and limitations for deductions, it's always wise to consult with a tax professional. They can help ensure you're maximizing your deductions while staying compliant with tax laws.

## Why Do We Pay Taxes?

Taxes fund government services and infrastructure that benefit society like defense, highways, police, and the justice system. While nobody enjoys paying taxes, they are essential for maintaining the services we rely on every day.

## What Are Tax Deductions?

Tax deductions reduce your taxable income, lowering your tax bill. Think of them as tax incentives. Common deductions include contributions to retirement accounts, student loan interest, and charitable contributions.

You can choose between taking the standard deduction or itemizing your deductions.

### For the 2023 tax year, the standard deduction is:

ðŸ’¸ $13,850 for single or married filing separately

ðŸ’¸ $27,700 for married couples filing jointly

ðŸ’¸ $20,800 for head of household

\*The year is not a typo â€“ we're talking 2023 right now since those are the taxes we're working on and that are due on April 15, 2024 ðŸ˜Ž

However, many people may benefit from itemizing their deductions instead, especially if they have significant expenses in categories like mortgage interest, property taxes, medical expenses, or charitable contributions.

Note that you will take either the standard deduction or itemize. If you itemize and it's less than the standard deduction, you're usually better off not itemizing.

Regardless of whether you take the standard deduction or itemize, though, you can deduct these expenses:

ðŸ’° Alimony payments

ðŸ’° Business use of your car and/or home

ðŸ’° Money you put in a traditional IRA\*, traditional 401k, or HSA

ðŸ’° Student loan interest

ðŸ’° Teacher expenses ($300; $600 if both spouses are teachers)

ðŸ’° For some: work-related education expenses

ðŸ’° For military service members: moving expenses

\*Note the little asterisk by the IRA. Only certain peeps get to deduct those contributions. You can see if you qualify [here](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/ira-deduction-limits).

Other common tax deductions include expenses related to healthcare, such as medical and dental expenses that exceed a certain percentage of your adjusted gross income, as well as education-related deductions like student loan interest and tuition fees.

If you're self-employed or own a small business, you may be eligible to deduct business-related expenses such as office supplies, equipment, travel, and professional fees.

But again, always work with an accountant to make sure what you are deducting is deductible in the eyes of Uncle Sam.

## Federal Income Tax Due Date

The deadline to file your taxes is Monday April 15, 2024 also known as Tax Day. Don't miss this date to avoid penalties and interest.

## Tax Planning: A Year-Round Adventure

Taxes aren't just a once-a-year deal. Staying on top of them throughout the year can save you a lot of stress (and possibly money) when tax time rolls around. If you're self-employed or have a side hustle, setting aside a portion of your income for taxes can prevent a big surprise bill in April. And if you're expecting to owe a lot, making estimated tax payments quarterly can spread out the burden.

Think of it like a tax savings account â€“ a little bit each month adds up and keeps you from scrambling at the last minute. So, make tax planning a part of your regular financial routine, and you'll thank yourself later!

## Wrapping Up

Taxes might seem overwhelming, but knowing the basics is crucial for managing your finances effectively. Remember, no one cares about your money as much as you do, so take an active role in understanding and filing your taxes.

Make sure you are optimizing your investments by taking advantage of tax advantage accounts as much as possible this year:
