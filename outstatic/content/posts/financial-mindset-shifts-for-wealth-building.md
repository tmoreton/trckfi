This specific 'thing' is what sets millionaires apart in their financial journey. And no it's not just about how much they earn, but how they think about and handle their money.

Our behavior is very much dictated by our **"money mindset**". I'll show you how mindset can get us closer to [financial freedom](/blog/achieve-financial-independence-guide-to-freedom) or keep us stuck in a cycle of scarcity.

So, are you ready to find out if your money mindset is the key to unlocking your financial potential? Let’s get started!

## What does 'money mindset' even mean?

Mindsets, particularly about money, are interesting. They quietly dictate our lives, much like the air we breathe. With the appropriate mindset, anything is achievable, but with the wrong one, it's terrible as hell.

Our approach to finances and our attitudes toward making, growing, managing money, and achieving financial freedom are fundamentally a reflection of our money mindset. This mindset profoundly influences our financial health, dictating the success or failure of our interactions with money and our journey towards [financial independence](/blog/how-to-retire-early-fire-movement).

## More Money Doesn't Solve Our All Our Issues

How many times do we find ourselves in a situation where we feel more money would solve it all? And then more money comes… and we find ourselves again needing more?

I'm a firm believer that the solution to our money problems is not money but actually a change in our mindset. Let's unpack this because I know it's confusing.

Whenever financial problems grab us by the neck, all we pray for is a shower of money to wipe away the so-not-little annoyance, forgetting it's our money mindsets that got us in the shithole to begin with.

So yeah, more money won't solve all of our issues, unless our** basic needs like food, health and shelter are not being met** \- in that case, money plays a huge role!

If you have food, shelter and health, I can confidently say more money will not solve your problems.

## **Discovering the Money Mindset**

I learned something really important about money that changed everything for me. It's like turning on a light in a dark room - all of a sudden, I could see how to be better with my money.

I stopped blaming others when I had money problems. Instead, I started looking at how I spend my money and how I think about it. I learned why I make certain choices with my money, and this helped me make better choices. Now, I'm saving more money and spending it on things that are important to me, not to others. This allows me to live "my rich life" today.

## **The Scarcity Mindset – A Common Culprit**:

Sometimes, without realizing it, we think there's never enough money, which we call a **"Scarcity Mindset"**. This way of thinking makes us believe we don't have enough money, which affects how we use it.

It makes us have a limited view of money, where our first thought is to spend it. Saving and investing come later, only if we have some money left. This is different from how people [who are really good](/blog/essential-financial-concepts) with money handle their wealth.

## **Breaking Free from Scarcity**

To get over this way of thinking, we need to start seeing money as something that can increase and grow when we manage it in a smart and flexible way. Thinking there's never enough [money keeps us worried](/blog/how-to-get-out-of-debt) about it all the time, making us only think about what we need right now instead of how to have more in the future.

By changing how we see money, we can start to think of it as something that can always become more, helping us move towards real [financial freedom](/blog/how-much-cash-emergency-fund-guide).

## Here's How to Fix Your Money Mindset

To shift from a scarcity to an abundance mindset, consider these actionable steps:

1. **Watch Your Words**: Pay attention to the words you use. Instead of saying things like "I can't" or "there's not enough," try using words like "I can," "possibility," and "enough."

2. **Be Thankful**: Think about what you already have and be thankful for it. This helps you see all the good stuff you've got, making you more open to getting even more.

3. **Get Comfortable with Change**: Notice how you feel about changes. If you're scared or don't like it, try to do things differently anyway. Taking small steps one at a time can help you feel better about change and see new chances.

4. **Don't Compare Yourself**: Stop looking at what others have and don't worry about their path. Remember, your journey is your own, so focus on making it the best it can be.

5. **Hang Out with Positive People**: Spend time with friends who look at the bright side. Their good vibes can help you think more positively, making you feel like there's plenty to go around.

## Summary

Changing how you think about money from a feeling of never having enough to believing in plenty is a big step towards gaining financial freedom and success. By choosing to see money matters in a positive light, being thankful for what you have, and keeping company with optimistic people, you can move beyond old limits and set the stage for a wealthier life.
