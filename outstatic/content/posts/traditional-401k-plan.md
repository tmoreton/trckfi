## **What is a 401(k) Retirement Plan?**

A traditional 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan that you to save for retirement through automatic payroll deductions (pre-tax income). Your contributions grow tax-deferred. Many employers also match contributions up to a certain percentage. The contributions and any investment gains grow tax-deferred until withdrawal during retirement.

To participate in a\*\* traditional 401(k)\*\*, an employee must meet certain eligibility requirements, such as reaching a specific age or completing a set number of service years with the employer. Once eligible, employees can enroll during designated enrollment periods. To learn more about \**401(K)retirement plans*\*, read [this blog post](/blog/smart-401k-retirement-guide) I wrote.

### **Tax Benefits of 401(k) Plans**

One of the primary advantages of a traditional 401(k) is the tax benefits it offers. 401(k)\*\* contributions\*\* come out of your paycheck pre-tax, which means they are deducted from the employee's income, reducing your taxable income now. However, the contributions and earnings are taxed when withdrawn during retirement.

### **401(k) Contribution Limits**

Employer match is another attractive feature of traditional 401(k)s. Many employers offer a matching contribution, where they match a percentage of the employee's contributions up to a certain limit. This \*\*"free money" \*\*boosts the employee's retirement savings significantly.

Employees can contribute up to the annual contribution limit set by the IRS, which is $22,500 (for 2023), and individuals aged 50 or older can make catch-up contributions of an additional $7,500. The IRS recently announced the [2024 limits are increasing](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/401k-contribution-limits-175430718.html) to $23,000, with the catch-up remaining $7,500. The new amounts also apply to 403(b) plans, most 457 plans and Thrift Savings Plans. Take advantage of these generous limits.

### **Maximize Your 401(k)**

Contribute enough to get any employer match, take advantage of tax benefits, invest appropriately for your timeline, and use catch-up contributions if 50+. Maxing out a 401(k) sets you up for a comfortable retirement.

## **Investment Choices and Asset Allocation**

Traditional 401(k)s offer a range of investment options, typically including mutual funds, index funds, and target-date funds. Employees have the flexibility to choose from various asset classes and risk levels based on their investment preferences and risk tolerance.

Diversification is key to a successful retirement strategy. By spreading investments across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and cash, you can reduce your overall risk while seeking potential growth opportunities.

## **The Importance of Rolling Over Your 401(k)**

When you leave a job, one of the biggest financial decisions is what to do with your existing 401(k). While you may be tempted to just leave it with your previous employer, this can be a costly mistake.

Here's why you should roll over your 401(k) to an IRA or new employer's plan:

- **Vesting schedules**\- You may forfeit matching contributions if you haven't fully vested. Always check your vesting status before leaving.

- **Loss of oversight** \- Once you leave, you can't actively manage the investments or take loans/withdrawals. Out of sight, out of mind.

- **Hidden fees** \- Old 401(k)s often charge higher annual fees compared to IRAs. Those fees continually chip away at your balance.

- **Limited investment options** \- 401(k)s typically have a narrower selection of funds compared to IRAs.

- **Account consolidation**\- Rolling over to a single IRA simplifies managing your retirement savings.

- **Increased control**\- [IRAs](/blog/types-of-iras) offer more flexibility in investment selections, beneficiary choices, RMD management, and more.

I learned this lesson the hard way. I left a job years ago and lost track of a 401(k) with thousands in it. The lost 401(k) balance would be worth so much more today if I had taken control and rolled it over to an IRA. Don't make the same mistake!

## **Withdrawing Funds**

Accessing funds from a traditional 401(k) usually begins at age 59.5, with exceptions for early withdrawals. Early withdrawals before this age may incur a 10% penalty in addition to income taxes.

In retirement, Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) are mandatory by age 72, determined by the account balance and life expectancy. Failing to take RMDs can lead to substantial penalties
