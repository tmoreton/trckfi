I find that this time of year tends to be oddly emotional as we adapt to a new year and navigate the seasonal changes.

Specifically around Valentine’s Day, half of February is gone and it’s easy to feel a type of way if you aren’t where you want to be.

And even if you are where you want to be, it’s okay to not feel okay too.

As the first quarter progresses, it’s natural for us to begin seeking out new opportunities and setting fresh objectives. Our culture constantly bombards us with messages to hustle harder, aim for more, and live a life defined by others’ standards of success.

This phenomenon, known as **lifestyle creep**, happens when we start spending more whenever our income increases. But we need to ask ourselves - at what cost? We work harder, aiming for 'more'—more money, bigger houses, newer cars, lavish vacations—all to impress others. This race often leads to more stress and less happiness, as we chase goals that aren’t really our own and we compare to others.
