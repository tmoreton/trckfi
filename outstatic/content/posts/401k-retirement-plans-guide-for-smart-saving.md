Saving for retirement is crucial if you want to maintain your standard of living in the future. 401(k) plans are one of the **best tools** out there to help you save and invest for [retirement](/blog/iras-vs-401ks-choosing-retirement-plan). But how exactly do they work? Let’s break it down step-by-step so you can make the most of your 401(k).

## What is a 401(k) Retirement Plan?

A 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement savings account that allows you to contribute a portion of each paycheck toward retirement. The money is taken out of your pay pre-tax, which reduces your current taxable income.

401(k) **contributions are invested** based on your selections, usually from a menu of mutual funds, ETFs, and other options your employer offers. The investments grow tax-deferred over your career. You pay income taxes on withdrawals in retirement.

### The two main types are traditional and Roth 401(k)s:

#### Traditional 401(k)

- Contributions made pre-tax

- Pay taxes when you withdraw funds in [retirement](/blog/traditional-401k-plan)

- Immediate tax break plus tax-deferred growth

#### Roth 401(k)

- Contributions [made after-tax](/blog/roth-401k-plans)

- Qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement

- Benefit from decades of tax-free growth

### Employer Matching

One of the best 401(k) perks is employer matching contributions. If offered, make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This free extra retirement money can add up to thousands per year.

### Contribution Limits

As of 2023, the annual contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 for individuals under 50 years old. If you're 50 or older, you can make an additional catch-up contribution of up to $7,500. It's essential to maximize your contributions to take full advantage of the tax benefits and grow your retirement savings faster.

The **IRS announced** that employee contribution limits for 401(k) plans is [increasing to $23,000 in 2024](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/01/irs-401k-ira-contribution-limits-for-2024.html), up from $22,500 in 2023, and **catch-up contributions** for savers age 50 and older will remain unchanged at $7,500.

## Investment Options

401(k)s offer various investment options like mutual funds, target date funds based on your retirement timeline, index funds that track market indexes, and in some plans, company stock.

It's crucial to properly allocate your investments across different asset classes and risk levels for diversification. Many plans offer target date funds that automatically rebalance.

## Withdrawing Funds

You can start penalty-free 401(k) withdrawals at age 59.5. Required minimum distributions (RMDs) force you to withdraw money starting at age 72 to avoid penalties. Roth 401(k) withdrawals may be tax-free if qualified.

In most cases, early withdrawals trigger income taxes and a 10% early withdrawal penalty. However, some exceptions apply, such as financial hardship or specific distributions for medical expenses or first-time home purchases.

## Rolling Over Your 401(k)

When you leave an employer, roll your 401(k) into an [IRA](/blog/types-of-ira-investing) or your new employer's plan to maintain control. IRAs offer more investment flexibility and lower fees. Leaving the funds in your former employer's plan is not recommended because it may limit your investment options and could result in higher fees, hindering the potential growth of your retirement savings.

## The bottom line

A 401(k) is a powerful tool you have at your disposal to save and invest for retirement in a tax-advantaged way. Take full advantage by contributing up to the limits, capturing any employer match, investing wisely, and rolling it over to an IRA when changing jobs. Master these 401(k) basics, and you'll be on the path to a comfortable retirement.
