## The Purpose of Saving: Building a Financial Safety Net

Saving isn't just about putting money aside; it's about constructing a safety net for your finances. At its core, saving serves three crucial purposes:

**1\. Emergency Fund: Your Financial Lifesaver**

Imagine having a [financial cushion](/blog/building-an-emergency-fund) that acts as your lifeline during unexpected storms. This is what your emergency fund represents. It offers peace of mind and financial security in the face of unexpected crises like medical bills, car repairs, or sudden job loss.

*Tip: Aim to save at least three months' worth of living expenses in your emergency fund. For example, if your monthly expenses total $3,000, your emergency fund should ideally reach $9,000. But don't get overwhelmed by this number, instead make a plan to start today. Whether is $100 per week or per month that you can put it towards your savings. Just do it!*

**2\. Savings Goals: Turning Dreams into Reality**

Saving empowers you to achieve your goals whatever these are. Whether it's the dream of buying a home, a Europe summer vacation, a new wardrobe or a new iPhone, saving allows you to set and reach your financial goals. The journey begins by starting small and cultivating a saving habit that aligns with your dreams. So put the excuses aside and start.

*Example: Suppose you dream Europe vacation costs $2,400. By saving $100 per week, you can achieve this goal in just 6 months, right on time for the Summer 2024. Now before you feel overwhelmed about how to save $100 every month, *[*review you weekly spending*](/features/transactions)*. You'll be surprised by your money leaks, anything you spend on things that don't really add value in your life and can easily be directed to your savings.*

**3\. Consistency is Your Greatest Ally**

One fundamental truth about saving is that it's not a quick fix; it's a good money habit you need to commit to. Consistent saving and then investing is what makes your long-term financial dreams a reality. It's about ingraining a habit that becomes second nature over time.

*Strategy: ****Pay yourself first.**** Set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your savings or even better a high-yield savings account each month. This ensures you save consistently without having to think about it. The reality is that *[*getting out of debt*](/blog/how-to-get-out-of-debt)* or changing our finances doesn't happen overnight but if there is one strategy that will help you achieve your money goals faster is paying yourself first and it gets easier the more you do it.*
