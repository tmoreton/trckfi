With all this talk about economic ups and downs, we're diving into a topic that's on everyone's minds: **cash** – how much is enough, and how much is too much? I get it – it can feel like everyone's shouting different advice, and it's hard to know what's what.

### How Much Cash Do You Need?

Let's start with the basics. You've probably heard various recommendations – from stashing a year's worth of expenses under your mattress to keeping everything in your checking account for easy access. But the truth is, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. Your ideal cash reserve depends on your unique circumstances and it's always better to be prepared and clear on your situation. Not sure what your monthly expenses are? Read more [here](/blog/tracking-monthly-expenses).

Of course, there are general guidelines suggesting having 4-6 months' worth of living expenses in cash as a buffer provides a safety net in case of emergencies, such as unexpected medical bills or unemployment. If you need $5,000 to survive every month, save $30,000.

However, an eight-month [emergency fund](/blog/building-an-emergency-fund) can be a better fit because that’s about how long it takes the average person to find a new job. As we all have seen an insane wave of layoffs over the past 12 months - according to layoff tracker [Layoffs.fyi ](http://layoffs.fyi/)\- tech companies alone laid off more than 260,000 workers last year and over 34,000 in 2024.

So ideally, you want to have enough cash to get you through a tough moment without having to turn into [credit card debt](/blog/how-to-get-out-of-debt) to sustain yourself and your dependents. It's going to give you peace of mind and resources to alleviate the stress that comes along with losing a job or any emergency situation.

### Where Should You Keep the Cash?

Now that we covered the basic idea of how much cash you should aim to have, let's look at where to keep it. There is a lot of bad advice on TikTok and other social media platforms that tell people to keep cash in their checking accounts in case they need a quick withdrawal. Or the opposite to invest it on the market... The reality you should make your money work for you but also keep it protected as you don't know when you will need it.

- Keep **one month of expenses** in your **checking account**, you don't need more than that. You can always set your savings account as a backup to avoid defaulting on a withdrawal.

- Earn interest in your emergency cash. Open a high-yield saving account that earns more than 4% APY and is FDIC insured. Ally Bank provides a great HYSA and you can [earn up to $125 when you join](https://www.ally.com/referral?code=4H3G4S7N9D).

But what if you're a small business owner? The equation shifts slightly. Having a robust cash reserve can mean the difference between weathering a storm and shuttering your business. In times of crisis, having cash on hand allows you to cover operational expenses, retain employees, and pivot your strategy as needed. It's your lifeline when unforeseen challenges arise. So, how do you strike the right balance? Here are some actionable tips to guide you: Assess Your Needs: Take stock of your financial situation. Consider your monthly expenses, income sources, and any potential risks or obligations. This evaluation will help you determine how much cash you need to keep on hand. Emergency Fund Essentials: Aim to build a robust emergency fund equivalent to 4-6 months' worth of expenses. This fund should cover necessities like rent or mortgage payments, utilities, groceries, and insurance premiums. Diversify Your Holdings: While cash is king in emergencies, it's essential to diversify your holdings for long-term financial stability. Explore investment options such as stocks, bonds, and real estate to grow your wealth over time. Regularly Reevaluate: Life is unpredictable, and your financial needs may change over time. Make it a habit to reassess your cash reserves periodically and adjust them as necessary. A windfall, job change, or major life event may warrant a reassessment of your financial priorities. Plan for the Unexpected: Anticipate potential setbacks and plan accordingly. Consider factors like job security, health issues, or market downturns when determining your cash needs. A proactive approach can help you navigate challenges with confidence. Seek Professional Guidance: If you're unsure about the best approach for your financial situation, don't hesitate to seek advice from a qualified financial advisor. They can offer personalized guidance based on your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. In conclusion, the question of how much cash is enough is a deeply personal one. While general guidelines provide a helpful starting point, it's crucial to tailor your approach to your individual circumstances. By striking the right balance between liquidity and growth, you can build a solid financial foundation that withstands the test of time. So, take control of your cash management today and pave the way for a brighter financial future tomorrow.

The truth is, it depends on your financial situation. What everyone needs to keep in the bank from month to month is enough to cover the regular bills and discretionary spending, and a bit over for an emergency fund.
