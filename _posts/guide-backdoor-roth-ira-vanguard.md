Are you a high-income professional looking to contribute to a Roth IRA but earning "too much" to do so directly? Don't worry; there's a smart and legal way to access the benefits of a Roth IRA, known as the [Backdoor Roth IRA](/blog/the-backdoor-roth-ira). In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of making your 2023 Backdoor Roth IRA contributions using Vanguard, a trusted investment company favored by many index fund investors.

## Step 1: Check Eligibility
Before you embark on the Backdoor Roth IRA journey, ensure you meet the eligibility criteria. The [Backdoor Roth IRA](/blog/the-backdoor-roth-ira) is an excellent option if you earn above the [Roth IRA](/blog/what-is-the-roth-IRA-avantage-2023) contribution income limits. For 2023, if your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) exceeds $228,000 as a couple filing jointly or $153,000 as an individual, direct Roth IRA contributions are not allowed. However, you can still take advantage of the backdoor strategy.

## Step 2: Open a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA with Vanguard
If you don't have a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA with Vanguard, start by opening these accounts. Visit the Vanguard homepage and select "Personal Investors" under "OUR SITES." Then, click on "Open an account" and follow the instructions to set up both accounts.

## Step 3: Make a Non-Deductible IRA Contribution
After logging in to your Vanguard account, go to "My Accounts" and select "Balance & holdings." Find your Traditional IRA account, click the three dots next to "Transact," and choose "Contribute to IRA." For the contribution year, select "2023" and enter the amount you wish to contribute (up to the annual limit of $6,500 or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Review and submit your IRA contribution.

## Step 4: Convert to Roth IRA (Brokerage Account)
If you have a brokerage IRA account with Vanguard, follow this step. On the third business day after your contribution is complete (for example, January 5th, 2023), you can convert the **non-deductible IRA** contribution to a **Roth IRA**. Click on the oval saying "Convert to Roth IRA." Choose the account to convert (likely your only [Traditional IRA](/blog/traditional-ira-buidling-a-tax-advantage-retirement)) and select "Convert all of the account." Continue to the next screen, where you'll be asked which Roth IRA to convert to (if you have more than one). Confirm your conversion and withholding election (choose "0" for federal withholding). Review the information and submit your Roth conversion.

## Step 4: Exchange to Roth IRA (Mutual Fund Account)
If your IRA account with Vanguard is a mutual fund IRA account, you'll need to "exchange" to a Roth IRA. Click the three dots next to "Transact" and select "Exchange (sell to buy) Vanguard funds." Choose the fund with your IRA contribution and click "Sell all shares" on the left. On the right, indicate that the money is going into your Roth IRA. Confirm your withholding election (choose "0" for federal withholding). Review the information and submit your Roth conversion.

## Step 5: Invest in the Roth IRA (Brokerage Account)
After converting your non-deductible IRA contribution to a Roth IRA, it's time to invest the money for potential growth. Click the three dots next to "Transact" and select "Buy Vanguard Funds." Choose the fund you want to invest in (e.g., VTIAX for international stocks), enter the balance from your settlement fund, and select the funding method (usually your settlement fund). Review and submit your investment order.

## Step 6: Check IRS Form 8606 at Tax Time
At tax time, you will report your Backdoor Roth IRA contributions on IRS Form 8606. Ensure you follow the IRS instructions and report the appropriate information from your Vanguard accounts.

## Step 7: Explore Additional Roth IRA Strategies
If you're married, consider a Spousal Roth IRA for your spouse, even if they have no earned income. Additionally, explore other Roth conversion options, as income limits no longer apply to Roth conversions.
