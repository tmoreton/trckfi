# Simple  Monthly Financial Check-In Routine for Success

Welcome to the beginning of a new month, a perfect opportunity to take control of your finances and set yourself up for [success](/blog/track-finances-reach-financial-success). Your monthly financial check-in can be the game-changer you need. It's not just about [tracking expenses](/blog/tracking-monthly-expenses); it's a powerful tool for financial awareness and growth.

## Why Monthly Check-Ins Matter
### Financial Goals
Start by revisiting your financial goals. Whether it's building an [emergency fund](/blog/prepare-for-the-unexpected-the-value-of-building-an-emergency-fund) or saving for your dream vacation, clarifying your objectives keeps you motivated and on track.

### Calculating Income
Calculating your income is a fundamental step in taking control of your finances. It provides you with a clear picture of how much money you have to work with each month. Here's a bit more detail on this crucial process:

1. **Gather All Income Sources**: Start by making a comprehensive list of all the ways you earn money. This should include your primary source of income, like your salary, but don't stop there. Include any side hustles, freelance work, rental income, or passive income streams, such as dividends or interest from investments. The goal is to capture every dollar that comes your way.

2. **Regular vs. Irregular Income**: Distinguish between regular and irregular income sources. Regular income is the money you can reliably count on each month, like your salary. Irregular income sources might vary from month to month, such as freelance projects. Be sure to consider both when calculating your total income.

3. **Account for Taxes and Deductions**: Your income isn't the same as your take-home pay. If taxes or other deductions are automatically taken from your paycheck, use the net income (the amount that actually lands in your bank account) for your calculations. If you have irregular income, remember to set aside a portion for taxes and other expenses related to your work.

4. **Use Real Numbers**: To get an accurate picture of your financial situation, be honest about your income. Don't estimate or round numbers up or down. Use the actual figures, even if they fluctuate slightly from month to month.

5. **Include Windfalls**: Occasionally, you might receive unexpected windfalls, like a bonus at work, a tax refund, or a monetary gift. While these aren't regular income sources, they do impact your overall financial situation. Include windfalls in your income calculations, but be mindful of how you allocate this money.

6. **Set a Clear Timeframe**: When calculating income for the month, focus on that specific timeframe. If you're doing a monthly budget, only consider income expected to arrive during that month. For longer-term financial planning, you might extend your timeframe to cover several months or even a year.

By accurately calculating your income, you gain a solid foundation for managing your finances effectively. It empowers you to make informed decisions about budgeting, saving, and investing, ensuring that you're in control of your financial journey.

## Tracking Expenses
### Fixed Expenses
Fixed [expenses](/blog/tracking-monthly-expenses) are the financial obligations that you must meet every month, and they are typically non-negotiable. Managing these expenses efficiently is vital for maintaining financial stability. Here's a closer look at tackling fixed expenses:

1. **Rent or Mortgage**: Your housing costs are often the most substantial fixed expense. Whether you're renting or paying a mortgage, it's crucial to allocate the appropriate portion of your income to cover this expense. Falling behind on rent or mortgage payments can lead to financial stress and potential repercussions, so prioritize these payments.

2. **Utilities**: Utilities encompass electricity, water, gas, and other essential services required to maintain your home. These bills usually arrive monthly, and while you may not have control over the rates, you can manage your usage to some extent. Implement energy-saving practices to keep utility costs in check.

3. **Insurance Premiums**: Insurance is a non-negotiable expense that provides protection and peace of mind. This category includes health insurance, car insurance, and home insurance. Review your insurance policies periodically to ensure you have adequate coverage at the best possible rates.

4. **Loan Payments**: If you have outstanding loans, such as student loans or a car loan, these payments are fixed and need to be accounted for in your budget. Missing loan payments can negatively impact your credit score, so they should be prioritized.

5. **Subscription Services**: Some subscription services, like streaming platforms or gym memberships, may be considered fixed expenses if you're committed to them on a monthly basis. However, these can sometimes be adjusted or canceled to free up funds for other financial priorities.

Managing fixed expenses effectively sets the foundation for your [budget](/blog/five-truths-about-personal-finance#track-expences). By ensuring these critical obligations are met, you can allocate the remaining income toward your financial goals, such as saving, investing, or paying off debt.

### Variable Expenses
Variable expenses encompass the [spending categories](/blog/five-truths-about-personal-finance#realistic-budget) that can fluctuate from month to month, making them a bit more flexible than fixed expenses. Analyzing and tracking these expenses is essential for maintaining control over your budget. Here's a deeper dive into managing variable expenses:

1. **Groceries**: Groceries are a variable expense because the amount you spend can vary based on your meal planning, dietary choices, and shopping habits. To manage grocery expenses, consider creating a meal plan, using shopping lists, and taking advantage of sales and discounts.

2. **Dining Out**: This category includes expenses related to eating at restaurants, ordering takeout, or grabbing coffee on the go. While dining out can be enjoyable, it's essential to monitor this spending and ensure it aligns with your budget goals. Reducing dining out expenses can free up funds for other priorities.

3. **Entertainment**: Entertainment expenses cover a wide range of activities, from going to the movies to attending concerts or subscribing to streaming services. Evaluate your entertainment spending and look for opportunities to enjoy leisure activities without overspending.

4. **Shopping**: Variable expenses related to shopping can include clothing, electronics, and other discretionary purchases. Set limits on shopping expenses and consider differentiating between wants and needs when making purchasing decisions.

5. **Transportation**: Depending on your commuting habits, transportation costs can vary. Track expenses related to fuel, public transportation, or rideshares. Consider carpooling or using public transportation when feasible to reduce costs.

6. **Miscellaneous**: Miscellaneous expenses encompass any spending that doesn't fit neatly into other categories. These can range from gifts and pet-related expenses to home maintenance costs. Review these expenses regularly to identify areas where you can economize.

By scrutinizing your variable expenses, you gain insights into your spending habits and can identify areas where adjustments can be made to align with your financial goals. Tracking these expenses helps you make informed decisions about how to allocate your discretionary income effectively.

## Savings and Investments
Now, let's dive into the exciting part of your monthly financial check-in—your savings and investments. This step is where you can assess your progress towards your financial goals and make any necessary adjustments to stay on track.

1. **Review Your Savings**: Start by reviewing your savings accounts. Are you consistently contributing to your emergency fund or other short-term savings goals? Ensure that your savings are growing at a pace that aligns with your objectives.

2. **Check Your Investments**: If you have [investment accounts](/blog/retirement-planning-understanding-iras-and-401ks), such as a [401(k)](/blog/401k-retirement-plans-guide-for-smart-saving), [IRA](/blog/types-of-ira-investing), or brokerage account, it's time to evaluate their performance. Look at the overall returns and assess whether your investments are meeting your long-term financial goals. Keep in mind that investments can fluctuate, so focus on the bigger picture.

3. **Adjust Contributions**: Based on your review, determine if any adjustments are needed in your contributions. Perhaps you want to increase your monthly savings amount or rebalance your investment portfolio. These adjustments should reflect changes in your financial situation and goals.

4. **Stay Motivated**: Regularly reviewing your savings and investments keeps you motivated and focused on your financial journey. It's a chance to celebrate your progress and make informed decisions to achieve your goals more efficiently.

Remember that building wealth and achieving financial goals is a long-term endeavor. The consistency of your savings and investments, along with periodic check-ins, plays a pivotal role in your financial success. So, take this opportunity each month to ensure you're moving closer to the future you envision.

## Category Spending (Even If Budgets Aren't Your Thing)

Now, I get it – budgets aren't everyone's favorite topic. They can feel restrictive and rigid, but here's the thing: tracking your income versus spending patterns is still a crucial step on your financial journey. It doesn't have to be a traditional budget, but understanding where your money goes is essential. 

Here's how you can approach it, even if you're not a fan of the [classic budget](/blog/budgeting-made-easy)

1. **Allocate Your Income**: Begin by allocating a portion of your income to savings or specific financial goals. This part is non-negotiable. Setting money aside for your future self ensures you're building wealth and financial security.

2. **Spending Alignment**: While you may not want to track every penny, it's essential to ensure your spending aligns with your goals. Take a look at your spending patterns and ask yourself if your expenses reflect your priorities. Adjust where necessary to make sure your money works for you.

3. **Discover Creative Savings**: Instead of imposing strict limits, consider creative ways to save without feeling deprived. Meal planning can help reduce grocery expenses, and canceling unnecessary subscriptions can free up extra cash. Small changes in spending habits can lead to significant savings over time.

Think of it as a spending strategy rather than a budget. It's about making conscious choices with your money to achieve your financial objectives while still enjoying life. Remember, financial freedom isn't about restricting yourself; it's about giving yourself the freedom to prioritize what truly matters to you.

## Setting Financial Intentions

Throughout the month, monitor your progress and be open to adjusting your plan if needed. Celebrate even small financial victories to reinforce positive habits. Setting financial intentions is a proactive way to turn your financial dreams into reality and stay on track toward your long-term goals.
