## <a name="traditional-ira">**1. Traditional IRA: The Timeless Classic**</a>
The Traditional IRA is the seasoned veteran, reigning as the most popular individual tax-advantaged retirement account. Its features include:
- Contribution limits of $6,500 in 2023 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older), with potential tax-deductible contributions depending on your income and workplace retirement plan status.
- Tax-deferred investment earnings, keeping your money shielded from current taxes.
- Taxation on withdrawals in retirement, based on your tax rate at that time.
**Best for:** Those in higher tax brackets now, expecting lower tax rates in retirement, and without access to a workplace-sponsored retirement plan.

## <a name="roth-ira">**2. Roth IRA: The Tax-Free Champion**</a>
The Roth IRA stands as the ultimate tax-saving counterpart to the [Traditional IRA](/blog/traditional-ira-building-a-tax-advantaged-retirement). Its key features are:
- Non-deductible contributions with upfront tax payments, leading to completely tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- A maximum annual contribution of $6,500 in 2023 ($7,500 for those 50 and older), subject to income limits.
- Lenient withdrawal rules, allowing tax- and penalty-free withdrawals of contributions at any time.
**Best for:** Savers anticipating **higher tax brackets** in retirement, aiming to take advantage of tax-free withdrawals and potential early access to contributions.

## <a name="sep-ira">**3. SEP IRA: Simplified Employee Pension**</a>
A type of traditional IRA, the SEP IRA offers exceptional benefits for both employers and employees, including:
- High contribution limits, up to **25% of employee compensation** or $66,000 in 2023, whichever is less.
- Employer contributions required for all eligible employees, with a flexible contribution size based on business cash flow.
- Employers who are also sole proprietors can open a SEP IRA for themselves.
**Best for:** Small business owners seeking a cost-effective retirement plan and the ability to contribute for their employees.

## <a name="nondeducatible">**4. Nondeductible IRA: Making the Most of After-Tax Contributions**</a>
When traditional IRA contributions aren't deductible due to income limits, the Nondeductible IRA becomes a viable option, offering:
- After-tax contributions with tax-deferred growth on earnings within the account.
- Taxation on withdrawals based on earnings growth, excluding the principal (already taxed dollars).
**Best for:** Individuals who don't qualify for Roth or deductible IRA contributions.

## <a name="spoul-ira">**5. Spousal IRA: Equal Opportunities for Non-Working Spouses**</a>
For married couples, the Spousal IRA allows non-working spouses to contribute, provided certain criteria are met:
- Joint tax return filing with taxable compensation.
- Contribution limits mirroring traditional or Roth IRAs, based on age and other factors.
**Best for:** Low-income or non-working individuals married to someone with earned income.

## <a name="opportunities-non-working-spouses">6. SIMPLE IRA: Retirement Savings Incentive for Small Businesses**</a>
The SIMPLE IRA shares similarities with employer-sponsored 401(k)s and is designed for small businesses and self-employed individuals:
- Lower contribution limits compared to [401(k)s](/blog/traditional-401k-plan), with up to $15,500 in 2023.
- Employer-matching or fixed contributions required for eligible employees.
**Best for:** Smaller companies with fewer than 100 employees and self-employed individuals.

## <a name="self-direct">**7. Self-Directed IRA: Expanding Investment Horizons**</a>
Self-Directed IRAs, available in traditional and Roth forms, allow alternative investments beyond stocks and bonds:
- Requires a **trustee** or **custodian** specialized in handling unique investments.

**Best for:** Investors looking to diversify their portfolios with real estate, precious metals, and private companies.
